  <section><h2 id="what-is-micro-services">What is micro services</h2>
<p>Microservices refer to a software architecture pattern where an application is built as a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services. In this approach, the application is divided into multiple individual services, each responsible for a specific business functionality. These services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of each other.</p>
<h2 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h2>
<ol>
<li>Increased complexity: Microservices introduce additional complexity compared to monolithic architectures. With multiple services communicating and interacting, the overall system can become more challenging to design, develop, deploy, and maintain.</li>
<li>Distributed system challenges: Since microservices are distributed and operate independently, managing inter-service communication and ensuring data consistency across services can be complex. Implementing reliable communication, handling failures, and maintaining proper synchronization between services require careful planning and robust mechanisms.</li>
<li>Operational overhead: With microservices, you have multiple services to deploy, monitor, scale, and manage. This can increase the operational overhead as compared to a single monolithic application. Each service may have its own infrastructure requirements, dependencies, and configuration, which adds to the management complexity.</li>
<li>Development and testing complexities: Developing and testing microservices can be more intricate compared to monolithic applications. Services need to be developed, tested, and deployed independently, which may require additional effort and coordination among development teams. Ensuring proper integration and end-to-end testing across services is crucial.</li>
<li>Service orchestration: As the number of services grows, orchestrating and coordinating their interactions can become challenging. Implementing service discovery, load balancing, and maintaining service dependencies can require specialized tools or frameworks.</li>
<li>Potential performance overhead: The communication between microservices typically involves network calls, which can introduce some performance overhead compared to in-process function calls in a monolithic application. Careful consideration of network latency and service-to-service communication efficiency is required to mitigate this drawback.</li>
<li>Learning curve and skill requirements: Adopting microservices may require additional knowledge and skills from development teams. Understanding the principles, design patterns, and technologies associated with microservices is essential. It may involve a learning curve and initial setup cost for teams transitioning from traditional monolithic development approaches.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<ol>
<li>Scalability: Microservices allow for independent scaling of individual services based on their specific needs. You can allocate more resources to high-demand services without affecting the entire application. This scalability enables handling increased user traffic and accommodating growth more effectively.</li>
<li>Flexibility and Technology Diversity: Microservices offer the flexibility to use different technologies, frameworks, and programming languages for each service. This allows teams to choose the most suitable tools for specific tasks and adapt to evolving technology trends. It also enables leveraging the strengths of different technologies and integrating third-party services easily.</li>
<li>Independent Development and Deployment: Each microservice can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. Development teams can work on different services simultaneously, accelerating development cycles. Updates and bug fixes can be rolled out to individual services without affecting the entire system, facilitating faster release cycles and reducing time-to-market.</li>
<li>Improved Fault Isolation and Resilience: In a microservices architecture, if one service fails or experiences issues, it does not bring down the entire system. Services are isolated, so failures are contained to the affected service only, allowing the rest of the application to continue functioning. This fault isolation improves the overall system&rsquo;s resilience and availability.</li>
<li>Enhanced Maintainability: Microservices promote a modular approach, where each service focuses on a specific business functionality. This modularity makes it easier to understand, update, and maintain individual services. Teams can make changes without needing to comprehend the entire application, reducing the risk of unintended consequences.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="10-microservices-patterns-">📚10 Microservices Patterns 📚</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>🔍 Service Registry: This pattern involves managing the locations of services in a distributed system. It maintains a list of all available services and their locations, which can be queried by other services to find and communicate with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>⚡️ Circuit Breaker: This pattern is used to prevent cascading failures in a distributed system. It monitors the availability of a service and, if it detects a failure, it can quickly isolate the problematic service and prevent other services from being affected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🚪 API Gateway: This pattern provides a single entry point to a microservices-based system. It acts as a reverse proxy and routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservice. It can also perform authentication, rate limiting, and other security-related tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>📝 Event Sourcing: This pattern involves capturing all changes to the state of a system as a series of events. These events can be used to reconstruct the current state of the system at any point in time. This pattern is useful for systems with complex business logic that require auditability, traceability, or compliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🎭 Saga: This pattern is used to manage long-running transactions that involve multiple microservices. It ensures that all services involved in a transaction are completed successfully or rolled back in case of failures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>📚 CQRS: This pattern separates the read and writes operations of a system. It uses separate models for reads and writes, which allows for the optimization and scalability of each. This pattern is particularly useful for systems with high read-and-write workloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>💾 Database per Service: This pattern involves using a separate database for each microservice. This ensures that each microservice has its own data store, which can be optimized for its specific needs. It also helps to prevent coupling between services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🕺 Saga Choreography: This pattern is similar to the Saga pattern, but instead of having a central orchestrator, each microservice involved in the transaction communicates directly with other services to coordinate the transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🕸️ Service Mesh: This pattern provides a dedicated infrastructure layer for managing communication between microservices. It adds features such as load balancing, service discovery, and security to the network layer, which can be used by any microservice in the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🧳 Sidecar: This pattern involves deploying a separate process alongside a microservice, which handles certain tasks such as service discovery, load balancing, or communication with other services. This allows the microservice to focus on its core functionality, while the sidecar handles cross-cutting concerns.</p>
</li>
